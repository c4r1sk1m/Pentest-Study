Wireless Scanning:
- Aircrack-ng is used for WiFI Targets
- Airodump-ng is used to discovery and validate wireless targets:
        - helps identify:
            - ESSID: Extended Service Set Identifier
            - BSSID: Basic Serivce Set Identifier
- Use the [airmon-ng] command to configure the adapter in monitor mode:
    [airmon-ng start <interface-name>]

- Once the adpater is monitoring, you can use airodump-ng to start cpatuering packets
- Airodump-ng lets you export inn the following formats:
    1. TXT
    2. PCAP
    3. CSV

- Wireless Signal strength is measured in decibal milliwats (dBM), expressed in negative values.
  The closer the number is to 0, the stronger the sginal and closer you are to the source.

802.11 Frames |
---------------
- Frames packaged together data (packets) and define a beginning and ending as it is transferred to the recipient
- The BEACON FRAME, includes peroperties that disclose details about the AP that are used for association, including SSID, type of encryption, MAC, channel, and vendor

        Frame:                  Purpose:                                Subtype:
        Management Frame        Enables the the station to establish    Authetnication Frame
                                and sustain communication over the      Deauthentication Frame  
                                network with ann access point. The      Association request Frame
                                management packets faciliate the        Association response frame
                                authentication, association, and        Reassociation request frame
                                synchronization.                        Reassociation response frame
                                                                        Disassociation frame
                                                                        Beacon frame
                                                                        Probe request frame
                                                                        Probe response frame

        Control Frame           Helps ensure the data frames are        Request to Send (RTS) Frame
                                delivered to each station.              Acknowledgement frame

        Data Frame              Transfers the data within the body
                                of the frame from higher layers of
                                the OSI model, such as web content 
                                from an HTTP GET request.
