- Breaks down each attack for each platform.

        - Initial access            - Discovery
        - Execution                 - Lateral Movement
        - Persistence               - Collection
        - Privilidge escalation     - Exfiltration
        - Credential access         - Command and Control

  an attack pattern ID. The attack pattern provides a nuber of details related to a given attack
  including attack prerequisites, mitigation to counter the attack, steps to carry out
  the attack, example instancces, and in some caes, a mapping to relevant CWE IDs.
