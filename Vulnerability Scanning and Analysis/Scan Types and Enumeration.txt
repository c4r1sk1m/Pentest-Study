TCP Scan:
- Referred to as a full connect scan and uses an operating system's network function to perform the TCP threeway handshake with a target host
- The TCP scan is the default scan method when using NMAP if no other optin is provided
- When a scan is executed without service detection but with the -vv or -reason flag, NMAP provides the reason as to why the port was listed as open, closed, or filtered

Half-Open Scan:
- Never completes the 3 Way TCP handshake
- Also called the TCP SYN Scan
- Sends SYN Packets

UDP Scan:
- Are connectionless and can be unreliable
- Common services such as DNS, DHCP, NetBios, rely on broadcast messsages and are the intended targets for UDP scans

Enumeration:
- This step aids a pentester with further information collection:

        - host/machine names        - Applications
        - Networks                  - Operating Systems
        - Domains                   - services
        - Users                     - Tokens
        - Groups                    - Social Networking sites
        - Network Shares
        - Web Pages
